# LinkedIn Full-Stack JavaScript Development: MongoDB, Node, and React

Welcome to the repository for our Full-Stack JavaScript Development project! This project showcases the seamless integration of MongoDB, Node.js, and React.js, providing a robust and modern solution for web development.

## Key Features

### MongoDB
- **NoSQL Database:** Harness the power of MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and retrieve data efficiently.
- **Flexibility:** Embrace the flexibility of a schema-less database, allowing for agile development and quick iterations.

### Node.js
- **Server-Side JavaScript:** Utilize Node.js to run JavaScript on the server, enabling a unified language stack across the entire application.
- **Express.js Framework:** Build scalable and robust server-side applications with the Express.js framework.

### React.js
- **Efficient UI Components:** Leverage React.js to create modular and reusable UI components, ensuring a smooth and interactive user experience.
- **Virtual DOM:** Optimize performance with React's virtual DOM, minimizing unnecessary re-rendering and enhancing application speed.

### REST API
- **RESTful Architecture:** Implement a RESTful API design, allowing for standardized communication between the client and server.
- **Endpoints:** Define clear and intuitive endpoints to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

### Docker
- **Containerization:** Dockerize the application for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Isolation:** Achieve environment independence and isolate dependencies with Docker containers.

### Webpack
- **Module Bundling:** Use Webpack for efficient module bundling, optimizing the application for production deployment.
- **Hot Module Replacement:** Facilitate faster development with hot module replacement, enabling real-time updates during development.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:** `git clone <repository-url>`
2. **Install Dependencies:**`npm install` (for both server and client)
3. **Run the Application in separate powershalls:**
```
  "docker-compose up"
  "npm run dev:server"
  "npm run dev:bundler"
```
